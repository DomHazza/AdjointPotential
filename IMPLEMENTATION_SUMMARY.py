SUMMARY: Compressible Potential Flow Solver Implementation

This file contains a complete implementation of a compressible potential flow solver
for airfoil analysis, based on equations 2.2-2.7 from compressible flow theory.

EQUATIONS IMPLEMENTED:
======================

2.2: Wave equation for velocity potential (steady-state approximation)
2.3: Continuity equation: ∇·(ρ∇φ) = 0
2.4: Isentropic density relation
2.5: Isentropic pressure relation  
2.6: No-penetration boundary condition on airfoil surface
2.7: Far-field boundary condition

NUMERICAL METHOD:
================
- Finite difference discretization on structured grid
- Iterative solution of coupled nonlinear system
- Central differences for spatial derivatives
- Proper boundary condition enforcement

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
====================
- NACA 4-digit airfoil generation (symmetric and cambered)
- Multiple Mach number test cases (0.3, 0.5, 0.7)
- Comprehensive visualization (6 plots per case)
- Solution validation and convergence monitoring
- Physical property computation (Cp, local Mach, density, pressure)

RESULTS:
========
The solver successfully captures:
- Compressible flow effects (density/pressure variation)
- Acceleration around airfoil leading edge
- Proper subsonic flow behavior
- Realistic pressure distributions

Three test cases demonstrate different flow regimes with appropriate
physical behavior and good convergence properties.

The implementation provides a solid foundation for compressible potential
flow analysis and can be extended for optimization studies.
